# Facial Recognition Attendance System  

This project implements a **facial recognition-based attendance system** that automates the process of recording attendance. By leveraging real-time facial detection and recognition, the system eliminates manual input, providing an efficient and error-free solution for managing attendance in schools, colleges, and workplaces.  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Real-Time Facial Recognition**: Accurately detects and identifies faces using advanced algorithms.  
- **Automated Attendance Logging**: Records attendance instantly with time and date stamps.  
- **Secure Database Integration**: Stores user profiles and attendance data securely in SQLite or MySQL.  
- **Multi-user Detection**: Supports multiple faces in a single frame for group attendance.  
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs seamlessly on Windows, Linux, or Raspberry Pi devices.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- **OpenCV**: For facial detection and recognition.  
- **Python**: Backend programming for system functionality.  
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL for efficient data management.  
- **Optional UI**: Tkinter for desktop applications or Flask for web-based interfaces.  

## üìñ How to Use  
1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-recognition-attendance.git  
   cd facial-recognition-attendance  
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. **Run the application**:  
   - Enroll faces using the registration module.  
   - Start the recognition module to log attendance.  

4. **View attendance records**:  
   Access and manage records from the database or user interface.  

## üåü Future Enhancements  
- **Live Video Stream Integration**: For real-time recognition from camera feeds.  
- **Cloud Database Support**: Sync attendance data across multiple devices.  
- **Notification System**: Email or SMS alerts for attendance updates.
